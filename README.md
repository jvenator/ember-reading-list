# Ember Reading List App

Based on the [Warming Up with Ember](https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv/soup-to-bits-warming-up-with-ember) screencast by [CodeSchool](http://codeschool.com).

The original reference codebase can be found (HERE)(https://github.com/codeschool/EmberReadinglist).

## Branches

The *Firebase* branch is an attempt to implement (Firebase)(http://firebase.io) as the data store, rather than rely on fixtures.

## Next Steps

1. Implement Firebase as data store.
2. Re-build the project using the most recent version of (Ember-CLI)[http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/].
